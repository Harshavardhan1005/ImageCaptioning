# Image Captioning
1. Image captioning relies on two netwroks, CNN and RNN.
2. Inception V3 architecture is used for acquiring feature vectors for images and LSTM is
used for generating captions.These are merged to get the context from the images.
3. Image Captioning can make Google Image Search as good as Google Search,in this case first the image is converted into text and later search can be performmed based on the caption predicted. 
4. It can be used to describe the videos(CCTV) in real time by raising an alarm as soon as possible if there is any malicious activity performed.
5. Check output.gif for some random test images.
